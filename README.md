This repository focuses on the **cloud deployment pipeline and big data architecture**, not the mobile frontend or final model training.

##  Goal

To develop a **scalable, privacy-compliant cloud infrastructure** that processes large volumes of fruit image data, distributes a TensorFlow model, and applies dimensionality reduction with PySpark â€” all while ensuring cost-efficiency and GDPR alignment.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Implemented

* **AWS EMR** as scalable processing platform
* **PySpark** for distributed computation
* **Broadcasting model weights** across nodes
* **PCA** for feature dimensionality reduction
* **GDPR compliance**, via EU-region server enforcement
* **Cost-conscious architecture** for testing and demos only

---

##  Use Case Example

1.  Upload image dataset to AWS S3
2.  Launch EMR cluster (EU region only)
3.  Distribute model weights using `broadcast_model.py`
4.  Apply PCA reduction using `pca_reduction.py`
5.  Store transformed vectors for model training or inference
